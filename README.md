# Using Chicago Crime Data to Predict Motor Vehicle Theft with Machine Learning

This project explores whether large datasets tracking crime in Chicago could be used to predict the occurrence of a certain crime (motor vehicle theft).

## Repository Contents 

### 1. `ChicagoCrime.ipynb`
- Jupyter Notebook that includes the written analysis and code

### 2. `ChicagoCrime 9 25.html`
- HTML markdown of the Jupyter Notebook for easy viewing without running the code

### 3. `ChicagoCrime.csv`
- Dataset used in the analysis
- Put this file in the same directory as the. ipynb file (ChicagoCrime.ipynb)

### 4. `ChicagoNights.csv`
- Dataset used in the analysis
- Put this file in the same directory as the. ipynb file (ChicagoCrime.ipynb)

## How to Run 

#### 1. Clone the repository 
#### 2.	Verify that CSV files are in the same folder as ChicagoCrime.ipynb
#### 3.	Open ChicagoCrime.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook
#### 4.	Run all cells to reproduce the analysis
